Sinematic 8-second continuous shot in a war-torn Indonesian village at sunset. The camera closely follows a young male university student wearing a dirty light-blue campus jacket with bold text ‘Studio SiRafa’ printed on the back. He weaves through collapsed buildings, drifting smoke, and scattered debris. Nearby explosions rumble, and distant gunfire echoes through the air. Indonesian soldiers in camouflage uniforms take cover behind rubble, aiming their rifles and returning fire.
Despite the chaos, the student jogs casually toward a squad crouching behind a half-destroyed wall. Without stopping, he speaks in a relaxed tone using a strong Palembang accent:
‘Kak, Kak… aku nak betanyo. Ngapo coding program aku error ye?’
He stands still and hands over an Asus ROG laptop. One of the soldiers, dirty, exhausted, and annoyed, shouts back in a thick Palembang accent:
‘WOY! Lagi perang malah nanyo coding! Tanyo Pak Nando bae sano!’
All dialogue is in Indonesian with a strong Palembang dialect. Mood: dramatic, cinematic lighting, realistic motion, handheld camera feel.
